This is a Java application I built together with a classmate as part of a university project. It’s a small but complete program that helped us practice object-oriented programming and collaborative development.

🧩 About the Project

The project is built with Java and Maven and follows standard Java project structure. It allowed us to:

Practice modular and object-oriented design

Manage dependencies and build the project with Maven

Write clean, maintainable code while working together

🎯 Purpose

We created this project to:

Apply the Java skills we learned in class to a real application

Learn to work effectively as a team on a shared codebase

Strengthen our understanding of software development principles
